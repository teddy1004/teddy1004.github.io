> AngularJS is a great framework

    function MyCtrl($scope) {
        $scope.websites = [
            {
                name: "Twitter",
                link: "twitter.com"
            },
            {
                name: "Facebook",
                link: "facebook.com"
            }
        ];
    }

*Angular* is **Awesome**

~~I'm just joking~~
